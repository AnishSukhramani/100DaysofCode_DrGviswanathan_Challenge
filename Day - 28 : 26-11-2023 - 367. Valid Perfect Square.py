# Certainly! This code presents a Python class `Solution` that contains a method `isPerfectSquare`. This method checks whether a given number `num` is a perfect square or not.

# Here's the breakdown of the `isPerfectSquare` method:

# - **Function Signature**: 
#   - `isPerfectSquare(self, num)`: This method takes in an integer `num` as an argument and checks if it's a perfect square.

# - **Algorithm**:
#   - `a = num**(0.5)`: This line calculates the square root of the input `num` using the exponentiation operator `**`. It stores the square root value in the variable `a`.
#   - `b = int(a)`: It converts the square root value `a` to an integer using the `int()` function, storing the result in `b`. This effectively truncates any decimal part of `a`.
#   - The method then checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is equal to zero.
#     - If the difference is zero (`b - a == 0`), it implies that the square root calculated was a perfect integer, indicating that the original number `num` was a perfect square.
#     - If the difference is not zero, it means the square root wasn't a perfect integer, suggesting that `num` was not a perfect square.

# - **Return Value**:
#   - If the difference between the truncated and original square root is zero, the method returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a perfect square.
#   - Otherwise, it returns `False`, signifying that `num` is not a perfect square.

# This code implements a basic method to determine whether a given number is a perfect square using square root calculations and integer comparisons. For instance, if you call `isPerfectSquare(16)`, it will return `True` since 16 is a perfect square (4 * 4 = 16). Conversely, calling `isPerfectSquare(15)` will return `False` as 15 is not a perfect square.
