# The given Python code defines a class `Solution` that contains a method `singleNumber`. This method takes in a list of numbers `nums` as input.

# The purpose of the `singleNumber` method is to find and return the element that appears only once in the list `nums`, assuming all other elements appear exactly twice.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the method works:

# 1. `t1` is initialized as an empty list. This list will be used to keep track of elements encountered in the `nums` list.

# 2. The method iterates through each element in the `nums` list using a `for` loop that runs `len(nums)` times.

# 3. For each element in `nums`, the method checks if the element already exists in the `t1` list using the `if nums[i] not in t1` condition.

#     - If the element is not in the `t1` list, it means it's encountered for the first time. Therefore, the method appends it to the `t1` list using `t1.append(nums[i])`.
    
#     - If the element is already present in the `t1` list (which means it's encountered before), the method removes it from the `t1` list using `t1.remove(nums[i])`.

# 4. After iterating through all elements in the `nums` list, the `t1` list will ideally contain only the element that appeared only once.

# 5. The method returns the `t1` list, which should contain a single element - the element that appeared only once in the `nums` list.

# It's important to note that while this solution may work for finding the single number that appears once among duplicates, it might not be the most efficient solution, especially for larger input sizes, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the `if nums[i] not in t1` check within the loop, which in turn calls `t1.remove(nums[i])`, causing a potential O(n) operation on the list `t1`.
