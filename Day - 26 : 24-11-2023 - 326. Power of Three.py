# Certainly! This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isPowerOfThree` that checks whether a given integer `n` is a power of three. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

# 1. The method `isPowerOfThree` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on whether `n` is a power of three.
# 2. The first condition checks if `n` is less than or equal to zero or if it's an even number (`n % 2 == 0`). If either condition is met, it immediately returns `False` because neither zero nor even numbers can be a power of three.
# 3. The second condition checks if `n` is equal to 1, returning `True` immediately since 1 is indeed a power of three (specifically, 3^0 = 1).
# 4. If `n` doesn't satisfy the above conditions, it enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 1.
# 5. Inside the while loop, it checks whether `n` is divisible by 3 (`n % 3 == 0`). If `n` is not divisible by 3, it returns `False` because a number that is a power of three should be divisible by 3 until it reaches 1.
# 6. If `n` is divisible by 3, it divides `n` by 3 (`n = n / 3`) and continues the loop until `n` becomes 1. If at any point during this division process, `n` is not divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
# 7. Finally, if the loop completes successfully and `n` becomes 1, it returns `True`, indicating that the original input `n` was indeed a power of three.
# This code essentially checks whether a given positive integer is a power of three by continuously dividing it by 3 until the result is 1 (or until it's no longer divisible by 3). If the process results in 1, the initial number was a power of three; otherwise, it wasn't.
