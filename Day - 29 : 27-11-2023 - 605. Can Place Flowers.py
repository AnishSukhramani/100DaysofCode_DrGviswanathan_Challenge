# This Python code defines a solution to the "Can Place Flowers" problem. The objective of this function `canPlaceFlowers` is to determine whether it's possible to plant n flowers in a flowerbed according to certain rules.

# Here's a breakdown of the code:

# - **Function Definition**: `def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool`
#   - It's a method within a class (`Solution`). This method takes in three parameters:
#     - `flowerbed`: a list representing the flowerbed where 0 denotes an empty plot and 1 denotes an existing flower.
#     - `n`: an integer representing the number of flowers to be planted.

# - **Base Case Check**:
#   - `if n == 0: return True`
#     - If there are no flowers to be planted (`n` is 0), it means the condition is already satisfied. Therefore, it returns `True` immediately.

# - **Loop through Flowerbed**:
#   - `for i in range(len(flowerbed)):` 
#     - Iterates through each plot in the flowerbed.

# - **Condition for Planting**:
#   - `if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i-1] == 0) and (i == len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0):`
#     - Checks if the current plot is empty (0) and also checks if its adjacent plots are empty or if it's at the boundaries of the flowerbed. If these conditions are met, it means a flower can be planted in the current plot.

# - **Planting the Flower**:
#   - `flowerbed[i] = 1`: Marks the current plot as planted (changes the value from 0 to 1).
#   - `n -= 1`: Decrements the count of remaining flowers to be planted.

# - **Check if All Flowers Planted**:
#   - `if n == 0: return True`
#     - If the required number of flowers (`n`) has been planted, it returns `True`.

# - **Return False**:
#   - If the loop completes without planting all required flowers, it means it's impossible to plant `n` flowers according to the given conditions. Thus, it returns `False`.

# This algorithm simulates the planting process by checking each plot in the flowerbed and placing a flower where conditions permit until the required number of flowers (`n`) is reached or determining it's impossible to do so.
