# This code defines a class called `Solution` that contains a method `containsDuplicate`. The purpose of the `containsDuplicate` method is to determine whether a given list of integers (`nums`) contains any duplicate elements. The method returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on whether duplicates are found or not.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
# 1. `nums.sort()`: The input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Sorting the list makes identical elements appear next to each other.
# 2. The `for` loop iterates through the sorted list `nums` starting from the second element (`i=1`) to the last element.
#    - `for i in range(1, len(nums)):`
# 3. Inside the loop:
#    - `if nums[i - 1] == nums[i]:` checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is equal to the previous element (`nums[i-1]`). If they are equal, it means a duplicate element is found because in a sorted list, identical elements will be adjacent after sorting.
# 4. If a duplicate element is found, the method immediately returns `True`, indicating that the list contains duplicates.
# 5. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the method returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain any duplicate elements.
# In summary, the `containsDuplicate` method sorts the input list `nums` and then checks if there are any adjacent elements that are the same. If it finds any duplicates, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
