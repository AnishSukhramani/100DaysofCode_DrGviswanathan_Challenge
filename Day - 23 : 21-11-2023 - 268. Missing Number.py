# The given Python code defines a class Solution with a method missingNumber that finds the missing number in an array of consecutive numbers from 0 to n, where n is the length of the array + 1. It uses the formula for the sum of consecutive numbers and subtracts the sum of the elements in the array to determine the missing number.
