# This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isHappy`. This method takes an integer `n` as input and checks whether it is a "happy" number or not.
# A "happy" number is a number that, when repeatedly replaced by the sum of the squares of its digits, eventually reaches 1. If it never reaches 1 but instead enters a cycle endlessly, it is not a happy number.
# Let's break down the code:
# 1. `arr=[]`: This initializes an empty list `arr` to keep track of the sums of squares encountered during the iteration.
# 2. The while loop `while n > 0` runs as long as the input number `n` is greater than zero.
# 3. Inside the loop:
#    - `dig_sum=0` initializes a variable `dig_sum` to zero, which will store the sum of squares of digits for the current number.
#    - The `for` loop `for i in str(n):` iterates through each digit of the number `n` after converting it to a string.
#    - `dig_sum+=int(i)**2` calculates the sum of squares of each digit and adds it to `dig_sum`.
# 4. After calculating `dig_sum`, the code checks:
#    - If the calculated `dig_sum` is already present in the `arr` list. If it is, it means the sequence has entered a cycle, so the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not happy.
#    - Otherwise, if the `dig_sum` equals 1, it means the number is happy, so the function returns `True`.
# 5. If none of the above conditions are met, the current `dig_sum` is added to the `arr` list to keep track of encountered sums.
# 6. Finally, `n = dig_sum` is set to continue the iteration with the newly calculated `dig_sum`.
# 7. If the while loop completes without finding a `dig_sum` equal to 1 or encountering a repeated `dig_sum`, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not happy.
# This code essentially checks whether the sequence of summing the squares of digits eventually reaches 1 (indicating a happy number) or enters a cycle (indicating a non-happy number) based on the defined conditions.
