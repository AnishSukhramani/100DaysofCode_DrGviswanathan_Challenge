# This Python class, `Solution`, defines a method `plusOne` that takes a list of digits as input and increments the number represented by those digits by 1. It does this by iterating through the digits from right to left. If a digit is 9, it is set to 0, and the loop continues to the next digit. If a digit is not 9, it is incremented by 1, and the updated list is returned. If the loop completes without encountering a non-9 digit, it means that all digits were 9, so a new digit 1 is added to the front of the list.
