# This Python class `Solution` contains a method called `getConcatenation`. The purpose of this method is to take a list of integers called `nums` and return a new list that is the concatenation of the input list with itself.

# The line `return nums*2` uses the multiplication operator (`*`) with a number `2` and the list `nums`. In Python, when you multiply a list by an integer, it creates a new list by repeating the elements of the original list that number of times. So, `nums*2` duplicates the elements of the list `nums` and returns a new list containing those elements twice in a row.

# For example, if `nums` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `nums*2` will return `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`, which is the original list `nums` repeated twice in a sequence.

# The method `getConcatenation` aims to achieve this functionality, essentially providing the concatenated version of the input list.
