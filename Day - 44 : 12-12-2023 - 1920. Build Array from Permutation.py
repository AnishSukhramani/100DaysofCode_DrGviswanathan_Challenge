# The given code represents a Python class Solution containing a method buildArray. This method takes in a list nums as an argument.

# Here's a breakdown of what the buildArray method does:

# It uses list comprehension, a concise way to create lists in Python, to generate a new list.
# The list comprehension iterates through the indices of the nums list using range(len(nums)).
# For each index i in the range of the length of nums, it accesses the element at index nums[i] in the nums list.
# The value obtained from nums[nums[i]] is appended to the new list being created.
# Finally, the method returns the new list that was built using the described process.
# It's important to note that this code assumes the elements of the nums list are valid indices themselves. 
# If the values in nums are not valid indices or if they exceed the length of the nums list, this code may raise an "IndexError". 
# Additionally, this code doesn't modify the original list nums; it generates a new list based on the values of nums.
